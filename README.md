# Simon Game

I created this project as part of the Udemy Bootcamp I finished in July 2022.
The goal was to practice JavaScript code, in particular eventlisteners and jQuery, along with HTML and CSS.

To play, the user needs to click on the colored buttons to repeat the sounds in a sequence randomly created by the algorithm.
